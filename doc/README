Introduction
------------
Tedcoin is a immutable voting system project derived, with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient Proof of Stake based cryptocurrency. Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake help further advance the field of cryptocurrency.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
	
	bin/32/tedcoind (headless, 32-bit)
	bin/64/tedcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to. You can enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall or forward port 

18775 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive incoming connections. Tedcoin works without incoming connections, but allowing incoming connections helps the tedcoin network.

Upgrade
-------

All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.

To upgrade first backup wallet:

	tedcoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>

Then shutdown tedcoind by:
	
	tedcoind stop

Start up the new tedcoind.
